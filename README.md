# Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting Environmental Variables on River Networks
This repository contains code for predicting environmental variables on river networks.
The model used for these predictions is a Deep Learning model that incorporates information from the river network.
The original intent of the model was to predict stream temperature and streamflow. 

This work is being developed by researchers in the Data Science branch of the US. Geological Survey and researchers at the University of Minnesota in Vipin Kumar's lab.
